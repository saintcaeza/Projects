// use the Coleman-Liau index to calculate the grade requred to read text
    // index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
    // where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text
    // where S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text




// program should print as output “Grade X” where “X” is the grade level computed
