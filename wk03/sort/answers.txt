sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It has the sorted case sort time so it has the best omega nota

time ./sort1 sorted50000.txt
time taken to sort
random5000.txt =
random10000.txt = .33s
random50000.txt = 15.472s

sorted5000.txt =
sorted10000.txt = .062s
sorted50000.txt = 1.812s

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: They share a simmilar(approximate) big 0 and omega notation

time ./sort2 sorted10000.txt
Time taken to sort
random5000.txt =
random10000.txt =  0.047s
random50000.txt = 3.911s

reversed5000.txt =
reversed10000.txt = 0.065
reversed50000.txt = 9.770

sorted5000.txt =
sorted10000.txt = 0.063
sorted50000.txt = 7.862

sort3 uses: Selection sort
How do you know?: I know because it takes the longest to sort the best case (sorted) so it matches the omega notation an big O notation too

time ./sort3 sorted5000.txt
time taken to sort
random5000.txt =
random10000.txt = 0.129s
random50000.txt = 0.735s
